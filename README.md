# DogeLanguage
A very cool compiled language.

- Full Docs in the WIKI!

- The language of Doges.

- Very similar in syntax to C++.

- The Parser is based on Lox.

- Requires llvm installed to build.

*Note:*

Doge is a very cool language, but the compiler is a bit old and unstable! 

A rewrite of Doge language will come along with this new [new compiler toolkit](https://github.com/PhilipPragerUrbina/Lexicographer)!
